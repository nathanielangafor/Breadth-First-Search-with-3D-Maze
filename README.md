# Breadth-First-Search-with-3D-Maze
This is a maze generator and solver. It generates a random 3D maze, uses Java to solve it and PJava to visualize it. This is my first actual project in Java so please excuse any redundancies in my code. If you are viewing this right now, it means I have not yet pushed the files onto the repo. Come back in 3 days.
